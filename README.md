# nand2tetris
This is my implementation of the projects in the [nand2tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

# hardware

The hardware is defined in .hdl files. It is simulated by using the Hardware Simulator tool provided in the course

- In [logic gates (Project01)](https://github.com/dklkushal07/nand2tetris/tree/master/logic%20gates%20(Project01)), the basic logic gates are built from NAND gate.(Some logic gates are dependent on others)
- In [ALU (Project02)](), basic combinational circuits like the full adder, half adder, etc are built
